# Document-Clustering-and-Topic-Modeling

Clustered unlabeled documents into groups and discovered latent semantic structures. 

Created a mapping vis tokenizing, stemming and stop-words removing and converted raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features.

Trained unsupervised learning models including K-Means Clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Identified latent topics and keywords of each documents for clustering and visualized training results by dimension reduction using Principle Component Analysis (PCA).
